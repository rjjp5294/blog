    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Hi, me! It's me, me! The pleasure is all mine.<br><br>This is my first attempt
      at creating some sort of website, but for real this time. Obviously this is
      the about me part so I guess we can get into that. I am 25 years old, living in
      New York City and working in the hotel industry as a Revenue Analyst. Specifically,
      I work at the <a href="https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/" target="_blank"><b>Royalton Park Avenue</b></a>.
      Hit me up for rates and come say hi sometime. This webpage is hopefully a testament to what I hope will be a budding career in technology and
      code. I know a bit of Pyhton, some Javascript, not an expert of any kind but I believe
      my biggest strength as of right now is that I believe I have a pretty strong understanding
      of the kind of thinking and mechanics of logic that really constitute coding.
      </p>

    <p>Outside of my aspiring programming interests, I like salsa dancing, playing my electric
      guitar either just by myself in my room or with other compitent musicians. I'm no professional
      in either, but I am getting the hang (sorta) of the whole salsa dancing thing.
      </p>
